    <h2>WHY I Created This Website</h2>
    <p>
  💻 Why I Created “becomingHER” — A Movement, Not Just a Website

It started with a quiet test at school—an anxiety self-assessment tucked between regular classes. Most students shrugged it off. But the results hit harder than anyone expected. A surprising number of us, including myself, scored high. Yet no one really talked about it. There were no conversations, no safe spaces—just silence.

I’ve always been the kind of person who *feels deeply*, not just for myself, but for those around me. I noticed how so many girls were silently struggling—balancing ambition with anxiety, expectation with self-doubt. And I saw how easy it was to dismiss it all as “just a phase.”

But it’s not just a phase.

I know that because I’ve lived it. I’ve been called average. I’ve heard the whispers that I wouldn’t make it. My “glow-up” wasn’t sudden or aesthetic—it was built on early mornings, quiet determination, and showing up for myself when it was hardest. And that’s what becomingHER is about.

**becomingHER isn’t just a website. It’s a space for healing, growth, and transformation.**

I built it for the girl I used to be—confused, overwhelmed, yet ambitious. I didn’t want other girls to waste time figuring it out alone. I wanted to build something that *guides*, *supports*, and *empowers*—freely, openly, and without shame.

This is not a passion project for college applications.

This is a movement.
A promise to girls who are tired of being told they’re “too emotional,” “too dramatic,” or “not enough.”
A space where mental health meets productivity, where ambition and softness coexist.
Where healing is as celebrated as hustling.

**becomingHER** is for every girl who’s ever felt unseen.
And I’m building it so she never has to feel that way again.
