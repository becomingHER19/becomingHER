    <h2>WHY I Created This Website</h2>
    <p>
      It all began with a small anxiety and depression test conducted in school by the psychology department. When the results came out, a majority of us—including me—were silently suffering from anxiety. It made me realise how deeply our mental health is being ignored in our everyday lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve always been a sensitive soul, deeply in tune with my emotions. This space was born from that feeling. A safe corner of the internet where women could come together, reflect, heal, and glow up—not just outside, but from within.

    <h2>My Glow Up Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I used to label myself as "average." I believed I wasn't special, wasn’t smart enough, not beautiful enough. But somewhere along the way, I shifted my mindset. I began saying, "I’m not average; I’m learning. I’m growing. I’m becoming HER."
    </p>
    <p>
      My glow-up wasn’t overnight. It took tears, journaling, boundary setting, 4 AM wake-ups, and believing in myself when no one else did. This space exists because I know how lonely that journey can be, and I want to walk it with you.

    <h3>✨ From Me to You</h3>
    <p>
      I’ll be uploading more personal blogs, once a week. These will include mini self-discovery letters, lifestyle insights, and growth mindset updates. Stay with me as we grow together.
