      <h2>WHY I CREATED THIS</h2>
      <p>I started this website after an anxiety test at school revealed something surprising—so many of us are struggling quietly. Including me. That small realization led to a bigger purpose. I made this space because I deeply care about mental health, emotions, and growth. This is for the girls who overthink, who feel like they’re not enough, who want to love themselves but don’t know where to start. This is my love letter to healing.</p>

      <h2>MY GLOW UP JOURNEY</h2>
      <p>I used to call myself average. But that’s not true. I was just learning. I shifted my mindset from self-criticism to self-respect. I chose to show up for myself—day by day. I started journaling, waking up early, saying affirmations, studying smarter, and respecting my boundaries. I built HER—my higher version. The girl who’s healing and glowing from within. You can too.</p>
